# Dimension: API Contract Drift

## Charter

Audit this branch diff for **breaking changes to public contracts**: exported function signatures, public types, REST/GraphQL endpoint shapes, DB schema columns referenced by external consumers, event payloads, and CLI flags. Anything an external caller depends on is a contract; changing it without versioning / migration is a break.

## Anchoring (read before flagging)

Before flagging any finding, consult two sources the orchestrator provides:

1. **`conventions`** (verbatim from the repo's CLAUDE.md `## Conventions` section, possibly empty) — if non-empty, treat it as authoritative for what this codebase considers good. A finding that contradicts a stated convention is HIGH conviction; a finding that proposes a different pattern is LOW conviction.
2. **`exemplars`** (up to 3 sibling files of each changed file) — read at least one before flagging a structural / pattern issue. If the exemplars show a pattern your finding contradicts, raise conviction. If the exemplars show the codebase doesn't use the pattern you'd recommend, drop your finding to NIT or skip it. Do not propose patterns from training data when the codebase has a demonstrated alternative.

## What you flag

1. **Exported signature change.** A function/method whose parameter list or return type changed, and the symbol is exported. Flag HIGH if external consumers exist (cross-package, public npm publish, etc.), MED for internal cross-module.
2. **REST/GraphQL endpoint change.** Removed/renamed field in a response; changed required input; new required field with no migration. Flag HIGH.
3. **DB schema column drop or rename** referenced in app code (overlaps `db`). Flag MED here.
4. **Event payload schema change.** Renamed/dropped fields in events sent to queues, websockets, webhooks. Flag HIGH.
5. **CLI flag rename / removal** in a tool the user runs. Flag HIGH.
6. **Public type definition change.** Exported `interface` / `type` / `class` with a public member removed/renamed/retyped. Flag HIGH.

## Blocking-ness rubric

`issue (blocking)` reserved for contract changes that ship a breaking change without versioning or migration:
- Wire-format change to a public webhook / API with active external consumers
- Removed / renamed REST or GraphQL field; new required input without default
- Renamed / dropped fields in event payloads sent to queues, websockets, webhooks
- CLI flag renamed / removed in a tool users invoke
- Public type definition with member removed / renamed / retyped, and the type is imported cross-package

Everything else from this dim:
- Exported signature change consumed only within the package → `issue` (non-blocking)
- DB column drop where app code already migrated → `issue` (non-blocking)
- Additive change (new optional param) → `note` or `suggestion` (mention the docs update)
- Naming inconsistency in additive changes → `nit`
- Non-obvious good contract evolution (proper deprecation, dual-write window) worth naming → `praise`

Legacy mapping: prior "Flag CRITICAL / HIGH" with active-consumer evidence quoted → `issue (blocking)`. Everything else → non-blocking forms.

## Anti-overlap

- You do NOT flag migration safety (`db` owns backfill, locks, rollback).
- You do NOT flag the new code's quality (`structural`, `types`, `error-handling` own those).
- You do NOT flag test coverage of the contract change (`tests` owns this).

## FP calibration (LOW profile)

Calibrate to 0.6+ for triage to keep (LOW profile drops below 0.60 in stage 3). Heuristic: if you can quote the old signature AND the new signature AND name at least one consumer, conviction ≥ 0.8.

## Examples

**TRUE positive:** `lib/auth/index.ts` exports `verify(token: string): User` — changed to `verify(token: string, opts: VerifyOpts): User`. Used by 4 other packages in the monorepo. Conviction 0.95.

**FALSE positive:** `internal/utils/format.ts` (not exported from the package's `index.ts`, not imported cross-package) had a signature change. No external consumers. Conviction 0.3 — drop.
